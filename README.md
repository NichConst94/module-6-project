# module-6-project

Backlog feature: I chose to implement a user input feature into my program because the objective was to allow the user to input any address they wanted to so they can view the information for it. This was an important feature to add because it will be useful for some users to monitor where internet traffic is coming from and if it may be malicious. 

Test case: To test my new code, I used the echo command to simulate the user input feature of a random DNS server address. I used Github Actions to created a workflow YAML to check out the code, assign the correct permissions to the file so the file could execute, and used the echo command to send an address to the interpreter. Once the code ran successfully, the changes were finalized into the script. 

CI/CD Pipeline: This showcases the CI/CD pipeline because once changes are made to a file, tests are run to see if the code still works as expected. If the tests succeed, the changes are pushed to the repo and the app is redeployed without downtime. 

Challenges: The major challenge I encountered was learning the syntax of a workflow YAML file. I started out by practicing on one of Github's sample demonstrations and I gradually learned the syntax by scrolling through their documentation. This project has helped me understand how other scripting languages are structured and how different they are compared to other languages I've learned like Python and Java.
